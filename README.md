## 💡 Core Concept

- Every 30 minutes: recieve a push notification that says something like **"Get your life together, loser."**
- Start your day by **recording what needs to get done** — the app transcribes it and breaks it into actionable tasks.
- No fluff. No sugarcoating. Just brutal reminders to execute.
